## Overview

The **Automated Report Generation Tool** is a Python-based application that automates the process of generating and distributing sales reports. It fetches sales data from a Supabase database, creates a professional PDF report with tables and charts, and emails the report to specified recipients using Gmail with 2FA support. This tool is ideal for businesses looking to streamline their reporting workflows, saving time and reducing manual effort.

This project demonstrates my expertise in Python development, API integration, data visualization, and secure email automation—skills I bring to every client project on Upwork.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves sales data from a Supabase database using the Supabase Python client.
- **Report Generation**: Creates a PDF report with:
  - A title ("Electronics Sales Report").
  - A table of sales data (e.g., product names and sales figures).
  - A bar chart visualizing sales performance using Matplotlib.
- **Email Automation**: Sends the generated report as an email attachment via Gmail, supporting 2FA with app-specific passwords.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for database connections, report generation, and email sending.
- **Configurability**: Supports configuration via a JSON file (`config.json`) for table names and email recipients, with optional command-line overrides.
- **Testing**: Comes with a comprehensive test suite using `unittest` to ensure reliability, covering edge cases like empty datasets and email failures.
- **Mock Data**: Includes realistic mock data for an electronics store (e.g., MacBook Pro, iPhone 15 Pro) to demonstrate functionality out of the box.

## Sample Output

The tool generates a PDF report (`report.pdf`) with the following content, based on the mock data:

**Electronics Sales Report**

| id | product                | sales |
|----|------------------------|-------|
| 1  | MacBook Pro 14"        | 150   |
| 2  | iPhone 15 Pro          | 200   |
| 3  | Samsung Galaxy S23     | 180   |
| 4  | AirPods Pro            | 120   |
| 5  | USB-C Charger 65W      | 90    |
| 6  | Dell XPS 13            | 140   |
| 7  | Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones | 110   |

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- A Supabase account with a project set up
- A Gmail account with 2FA enabled and an app-specific password generated

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sobandev/automated-report-generator.git
   cd automated-report-generator
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   # source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
   ```
   Dependencies include `supabase`, `reportlab`, and `matplotlib`.

4. **Configure Supabase and Gmail**:
   - Copy `src/config_template.py` to `src/config.py`:
     ```bash
     copy src\config_template.py src\config.py  # On Windows
     # cp src/config_template.py src/config.py  # On macOS/Linux
     ```
   - Create a Supabase project and note your project URL and API key.
   - Run the SQL script in `docs/mock_data.sql` via the Supabase SQL Editor to create and populate the `sales_data` table with mock data:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE sales_data (
         id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
         product VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         sales INTEGER NOT NULL
     );

     INSERT INTO sales_data (product, sales) VALUES
         ('MacBook Pro 14"', 150),
         ('iPhone 15 Pro', 200),
         ('Samsung Galaxy S23', 180),
         ('AirPods Pro', 120),
         ('USB-C Charger 65W', 90),
         ('Dell XPS 13', 140),
         ('Sony WH-1000XM5 Headphones', 110);
     ```
   - Enable 2FA on your Gmail account and generate an app-specific password (under "App passwords" in your Google Account settings).
   - Update `src/config.py` with your Supabase and Gmail credentials:
     ```python
     # src/config.py
     SUPABASE_URL = 'your_supabase_url'
     SUPABASE_KEY = 'your_supabase_key'
     EMAIL_USER = 'your_email@gmail.com'
     EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_specific_password'
     ```

5. **Configure Email Recipient**:
   - Update `src/config.json` with the desired table name and email recipient:
     ```json
     {
         "table_name": "sales_data",
         "email_recipient": "recipient@example.com"
     }
     ```

## Usage

Run the application from the root directory:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Optional Command-Line Arguments
Override the default table name or email recipient:

```bash
python -m src.main --table "orders" --recipient "newrecipient@example.com"
```

### Expected Output
The script will:
1. Fetch sales data from Supabase.
2. Generate a PDF report (`report.pdf`) with a table and chart.
3. Send the report as an email attachment to the specified recipient.

Example output in the terminal:
```
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: GET https://your-supabase-url/rest/v1/sales_data?select=%2A "HTTP/2 200 OK"
Report generated: report.pdf
Email sent successfully.
```

## Running Tests

The project includes a test suite to ensure reliability. Run the tests from the root directory:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The tests cover:
- Database connectivity and data fetching.
- Report generation with empty datasets.
- Email sending functionality (mocked to avoid real email sends).

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**: Core programming language.
- **Supabase**: Cloud-based PostgreSQL database for data storage.
- **ReportLab**: For generating PDF reports with tables.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating bar charts in the report.
- **smtplib**: For sending emails via Gmail with 2FA support.
- **unittest**: For automated testing.

## Why This Project Stands Out

This project showcases my ability to:
- Build end-to-end automation solutions that save time for businesses.
- Integrate with modern cloud services like Supabase for data management.
- Create professional, visually appealing reports with data visualization.
- Implement secure email automation with 2FA support.
- Write clean, modular, and well-tested code with robust error handling.

It’s a practical example of how I can help clients streamline their workflows, reduce manual tasks, and deliver actionable insights through automated reporting.

### Final Steps to Ensure Everything Is Ready
1. **Save the README**:
   - Save this content as `docs/README.md` in your project directory (`D:\Cybers Lab\automated_report_generator\docs\README.md`).

2. **Create `src/config_template.py`** (if you haven’t already):
   Since we referenced `config_template.py` in the `README.md`, create this file in `src/`:
   ```python
   # src/config_template.py
   SUPABASE_URL = 'your_supabase_url'
   SUPABASE_KEY = 'your_supabase_key'
   EMAIL_USER = 'your_email@gmail.com'
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_app_specific_password'
   ```
  ```

- **GitHub Push Issues**: If you’re still having trouble pushing to GitHub, ensure you’ve authenticated with a personal access token (as described in the previous response) or set up SSH. Let me know if you need help with this!

Your project is now fully documented and ready to shine on both GitHub and Upwork. You’ve got a professional portfolio piece that showcases your skills! 🚀 If you need any more assistance, I’m here for you!
